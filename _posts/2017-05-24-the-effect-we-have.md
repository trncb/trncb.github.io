As I walked through some secondhand cigarette smoke on the way to a train station this morning, the cold air kept the smoke visible for ages after this person had exhaled. I watched as it drifted and floated. How it rolled and swerved as I moved through it.

Normally, cigarette smoke dissipates pretty quickly. This was the first time I could physically see the smoke for any decent length of time. Other than <a href="https://helpgrowchange.com/thank-you-public-smoker-for-your-second-hand-smoke/">how I feel about secondhand smoke</a>, this got me thinking about how we, as individuals, impact our environment.

We go through our lives not realising the physical effect we impress on this world because we don't see what happens. We are so self-centered, focused on ourselves and our future that we don't think there is a problem.

Our trash gets picked up every week, we flush our toilets, we drive our cars, we exhale cigarette smoke. All of these are examples of how we use things, then once we're done with them, they disappear 'somewhere'. We don't see it anymore so it's not our problem.

I'm guilty of this. I've been doing this for as long as I can remember. It's (mostly) not our fault as we've only been doing what we've been taught.

Maybe it's time we started to see and understand the bigger picture. Where does your rubbish end up? What's happens to all that shit you're flushing away (<em>pun intended</em>)? What effect is your secondhand smoke having on the people around you, bearing in mind you are one of hundreds of millions of other smokers exhaling their smoke into the air?

Climate Change is a massive problem and humanity has to face it otherwise we're in big trouble. The issue is too vast to overcome with expansive agreements and contracts. Governments have been trying that for decades - with no success. This isn't 'somebody else's' problem. It's your problem and it's my problem.

Change begins with the smallest step, and that means each of us individually. If you make a change now and influence at least one other person, that is magnificent. Imagine if they influence one other person, and that person influences the next, and so on. Eventually, we will find ourselves in the majority, all helping each other save our planet.

What can we do about this? Well, you can start off by separating your recyclable trash, really think about your power and water usage at home - I mean <em>really</em> think about it. Do you <em>need</em> to leave the T.V. on while you're on the other side of the house for 2 hours? Do you <em>need</em> to run a hot bath every night? Maybe switch to short showers on alternate days. Switch lights off if you're not in the room. It makes a difference. Seriously.

If you're already doing that, then try moving to compost bins for your food waste. Or look into more eco-friendly products (cleaning, hygiene, you name it, it's out there). Think about packaging. How much of it is recyclable or reusable. It can take a bit of effort, but it's well worth it. The more people are living environmentally friendly, the more mainstream it will become.

Remember this is our only home, and if we run it into ruin, we are fucked. What are you doing today to help humankind survive?

This is part 2 of my 3-part blog series on how you can rekindle your passion on a Sunday afternoon. In my previous post <a href="http://helpgrowchange.com/rekindle-part1">I challenged you to dream</a>. In this one, the challenge will be to draw out as much detail as possible from your dream and onto some paper.

Have you ever thought about your life dream? The one you deeply want to live, but find yourself not really moving towards it? Maybe you're bored or not sure if your current actions align with your dream. Even if you and I do have a dream, how do we <em>know</em> if we're doing the right thing? How do we <em>know</em> what we want?

The best way I've experienced this is to ask ourselves some hard questions. We find, and re-connect with, our <strong><em>'why'</em></strong>. Reconnecting with <em>why</em> we want our dream enables us to re-evaluate how far we've come, and what we still need to do.

So, here's the thing, on your lazy Sunday afternoon (<em>it doesn't have to be a Sunday by the way</em>), grab a pen and multiple pieces of paper.

<strong>Ask yourself 5 important questions.</strong>

<ul>
<li>What is my dream?</li>
<li>Why do I want this?</li>
<li>What do I want to achieve?</li>
<li>What can I offer?</li>
<li>What can I do?</li>
</ul>

These aren't easy questions. It took me quite a bit of time to answer them, as well as a shedload of mental energy. Yet, I highly recommend and encourage you to answer them as best you can - you will reap the rewards later. Answering these forced me to really <em>define</em> what I was thinking, hoping and dreaming.

As you fill out your story behind these questions, an amazing thing happens, you begin to feel the small feeling of butterflies in your abdomen, and excitement build in your chest. Commonalities will begin to emerge between your answers, and ideas begin to flow. Ideas for plans, ideas for business products, ideas on the route you need to take to reach your dream.

Remember, this is your <em>dream</em>, your purpose, where you want to be in your future. This isn't a goal you want to achieve, and there aren't any right or wrong answers. Just your dream, in your words.

Let's go over the questions in a bit more detail. 
(<em>To make this more 'readable', I've focussed only on the two most important questions in this post. The remainder will be covered off in part 3</em>)

<h2>What is my dream?</h2>

Write a story of a typical day of your future self. For simplicity, put a timeframe on it. I found 3-5 years was far enough in the future to be beyond a goal, but not too far that it became too farfetched.

As you think about your special day, relax...Feel the emotions you think you would feel. Fall into the dream, concentrate on as many details as you can.

Try to immerse yourself as much as you can. Ask yourself important questions such as; <em>Where am I? What am I feeling? What am I doing? What do my surroundings look like?</em>

As an example, I wrote about how my dream was centered around me being at home, working on this blog, preparing for a meeting in one of my businesses, and enjoying the simple pleasures of family time. For you it might revolve around being an author at a book launch, or a photographer in your studio, or even a manager in an executive meeting of some kind.

Write it all down. Don't worry about how silly it sounds, the format, or even spelling errors. Just write it down.

It's great to have a dream and something to aspire to, but there is a more important question to answer...

<h2>Why do I want this?</h2>

While it's all well and good knowing <em>where</em> you want to go, you will struggle to get there if you don't know <em>why</em> you want it.

<strong><em>Knowing why you want your dream is crucial in ensuring you can make it real.</em></strong>

Identifying why you want your dream brings real clarity. It defines your overall purpose, and allows you to focus on what you really want. When I defined my 'why', it hit me like a freight train. In the time since I did this exercise, I've gained more traction on my dream in a few weeks than I did in the last year!

<em>How do you answer this question</em>, you ask? Keep your dream from the previous question in your mind. Focus on that story, immerse yourself in it as much as you can. Now, what are you feeling? Why are you feeling that way? What has happened to make you feel this way? Write your anwers down - no editing, no thinking about structure, just your raw emotional thoughts straight onto the paper.

At the end of it, you will have your reasons for your dream. If they are truly your 'why', you will begin to feel a sense of purpose deep down. Your mind and heart will be cleared of indecision on where you want to be.

<h2>What's next?</h2>

The next few questions will cover further on how you can identify what you need to do to make your dream a reality. Stay tuned for part 3 next week. But don't go just yet. There is still your challenge for this week.

I challenge you to think and re-think your answers to <em>What is my dream?</em> and <em>Why do I want this?</em>. The more you think about it, the clearer the dream will be, and the stronger your sense of purpose will grow.

If you are not feeling this, you haven't found your <em>why</em>, and that's ok. These are difficult questions, and the answers will come with enough thought and emotion.

Answering these questions brought me clarity to why I'm doing what I'm doing - and that is family and flexibility.

<em>What is your why?</em>

Be sure to look out for part 3, where we will figure out how to begin the journey to achieving your life dream.

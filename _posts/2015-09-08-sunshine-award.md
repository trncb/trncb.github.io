No matter what anybody says, we all love a little recognition. We all appreciate a little acknowledgement for the effort we put in. Something to show that what we're doing is being heard.

This is what happened recently when Titia from <a href="http://we-embrace.com">w{e}mbrace</a> nominated me for a Sunshine award. <strong>Thank you, Titia</strong>. Thank you for taking the time to remember my blog. It makes me glad my message is getting through to at least one person.

The Sunshine award is an award bloggers pass on to other bloggers to encourage them to carry on with the great work they are doing.

<strong>The rules:</strong>
According to the rules, a nominee should:

<ul>
<li>Thank the person who nominated you.</li>
<li>Answer the questions from the person who nominated you.</li>
<li>Nominate other bloggers for the Sunshine Award.</li>
<li>Write the same number of questions for the bloggers you nominated as you received with your nomination.</li>
<li>Notify the bloggers you have nominated.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Titia's questions with my answers:</h3>

<em>Why did you start blogging?</em>
I wanted to make a positive impact on the world around me. My blog allowed me a place to take the words out of my head and put them somewhere. As I published more, I discovered people were actually reading my stuff, and it was changing their lives. That's why I continue to blog.

<em>If you could give other bloggers one tip what would it be?</em>
Be yourself. Don't try too hard to fit in with what the masses are writing or doing. There are other people out there like you. They will read your articles, they just need to find you first (which comes down to content marketing).

Bonus tip: have an effective content marketing plan if you want to be found. And no, I don't have one...yet. :)

<em>If you had unlimited funds what would you do with your time?</em>
Tough question. I certainly wouldn't be sitting on my ass. With unlimited funds, I think I would find ways to make environmental sustainability attainable and affordable in my community/town/country.

<em>What are you most grateful for?</em>
My loving wife who has supported me since we met. My 2 healthy young boys. A roof over my head at night. Everything else is a bonus.

<em>If you could change one thing in this world, what would it be?</em>
Our world will never be perfect, no matter what we change. But I think <em>money</em> has a lot to do with the state we're in at the moment. So, I'd get rid of money. No more rich/poor. No more societal status. No more corporate greed. Eventually (<em>hopefully?</em>) it will be a world of bartering and re-use, rather than a money-making machine.

<em>What's one of the top things on your bucket list?</em>
To fly. Whether it be a glider, or hand glider, I want to be soaring through the air with no machine noise.

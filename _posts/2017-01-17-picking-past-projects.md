I read an <a href="https://medium.com/personal-growth/isaac-asimov-how-to-never-run-out-of-ideas-again-b7bf8e09cc91#.kjcnppop2">interesting article</a> the other day about how Isaac Asimov could write as much as he did. One of the main points that struck me was how he wouldn&#039;t stay &quot;stuck&quot; on any one thing. If he did feel like he was stuck, he&#039;d simply move on to another project he had on the pile.

With my renewed focus on writing and planning some future pieces, I decided to look through my unfinished projects to see if anything came up. This snippet of a fictional story I started about 2 years ago stuck out, which I think you might find quite interesting.

I would love to know what you think?

...

Sam couldn’t wait to get out of the soaking rain and into the air-conditioned train. She couldn’t handle the rain matting her hair and ruining the collar of her favourite work blouse. Once aboard the train, she located a row near the back of the carriage where a tired looking, dark haired man sat by the left window, trying to fall asleep. An old man in a beige trench coat sat at the right window. She decided to sit next to the old man, thinking that she wouldn’t have to contend with snoring, or awkward positioning from the potential sleeper leaning over in his sleep.

Sam usually didn’t mind sleeping passengers on her commute, she just didn’t feel like it today. She had had a rough night with her toddler. He had come down with a fever yesterday and tended to overreact when he wasn’t well. After being woken up throughout the night, Sam was not in the mood to contend with discomfort.

“Good morning,&quot; said the old man with a smile as she sat beside him. <em>Wow, what a voice, she thought to herself.</em> She smiled and replied, “and to you”. “You look a little tired this morning, bad night?” he continued. <em>Soothing, like honey on a warm slice of toast.</em> “Yeah, my 3-year-old son is sick, and has a tendency to keep the household awake.” “That’s a shame,” he said. “I remember when my boy was that age. He would be very similar to your son.”

A crystal-clear image of a young boy emerged in her mind. <em>This man’s voice. It’s rapturous. Why do I have such a perfect image in my head?</em> The man continued with his resonating, pure voice “He would cry and cry. In his eyes, his mother was the only person who could comfort him”.

Just then, Sam was sure she heard a crying child - softly, almost as if it was at the far end of the train. The crying died down to a whimper, and a mother’s soft soothing murmur could be heard. Out the corner of her eye, Sam thought she saw a woman sitting in the empty seat across the aisle. She rocked gently, whispering soothing words in this child&#039;s ear. But when she turned to look, there was nothing. <em>What the hell?</em> She shook her head telling herself that the lack of sleep must be playing with her head.

The dark-haired, sleepy passenger across the aisle opened his eyes as Sam was watching. He glanced at the seat beside him, just where Sam&#039;s vision had been, shrugged his body uncomfortably, and closed his eyes again. <em>Did he notice it too? Surely not</em>, she thought.

...

<em>Who is the old man? Why is his voice so captivating? Did Sam really see the woman and child?</em>

Intriguing, I think I might just carry on this little project.

I&#039;d love to know your thoughts on this snippet. :)

Every day we deliver judgement on people in higher societal status positions such as Presidents, CEO's, celebrities, even our managers. We expect them to be 100% correct all the time. We expect them to act perfect all day every day. We lambaste them when they falter.

What we fail to realise most of the time, is they are still human - just like you and me. They, too, love watching a good movie. They also enjoy the relaxation of a lazy Sunday afternoon, or the sweet success of finally completing a personal project.

And - again, just like you and I - they fail. Often.

Recently, I watched the first few episodes of a new T.V. series named Lip Sync Battle. It's a show in which celebrities attempt to perform a live act on stage while lip syncing to a song of their choice. It's hilarious.

What was more interesting to me, was the opportunity to see a little more of the people behind the celebrity faces. Dwayne Johnson letting off steam to The BeeGees, or Anne Hathaway pulling off Miley Cyrus. The banter they had going between sets added further personality and insight into who they are.

It's about time we stopped putting celebrities and people of power on a pedestal. It's time we stop perceiving them as unattainable, different, or better than us.

Because they are not any different to us. They are still human.

Next time you're reading the gossip magazines, or news headlines about some mistake one of these people have made. <strong>Stop.</strong> Try <a href="http://helpgrowchange.com/shoes/">put yourself in their shoes</a>. Would you act the same way? What would you do in their situation? Have some empathy and compassion, as they are making the best decisions for them at any given point in time.

Bringing this closer to home, think about your managers, your friends, your family. What compassion can you show them when they have made a decision? What are they feeling when they make certain decisions? Sometimes, they certainly make bad decisions or a different one to you, but they made a decision all the same. How do you want people to treat you when you make a bad decision?

I'm guilty of being judgemental of others' decisions. I have laughed at celebrities, or baulked at a politician's personal response. I know I'm wrong, and I'm an ass for even thinking it. But I believe our world won't get any better if we continue in this way.

These people are human. Just like you and me. I can't imagine the pressure of the world watching me 24/7. Watching, waiting, pouncing on every word I speak with a vengeance, and talking as if they know me.

So, I'm going to cut them a little slack. How about you?

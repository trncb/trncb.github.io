My friend has <a href="http://skyewaters.com/hydrocephalus-making-sense-of-it-all/" target="_blank">Hydrocephalus</a>. I cannot begin to understand how hard it must be to live with something like that or any other debilitating condition.

I know of someone else who's child suffered leukaemia, another person who's wife is suffering cancer, and I've also worked with people who have keeled over with a heart attack or were killed in a tragic motorcycle accident.

These events and conditions of people that I am close to (and converse with on a daily basis) bring me to think about my own life and the health of my little family - and just how lucky and sheltered we are.

There is just no time to waste in our lives.

Every moment should be cherished.

But it's not that easy, is it? Life gets in the way. Children whine, and bad customer service ruins our days.

It's simply impossible to breathe in the moment all day, every day. I feel it, and I'm sure you do too. Everywhere on the Internet nowadays, we are being bombarded about mindfulness and embracing the Present. I struggle to do this all day.

What I have found, though, is if I consciously take a couple of minutes first thing in the morning and when lying in bed before I go to sleep, I find myself growing to appreciate a whole lot more in my life.

<h2>Make a conscious effort twice a day</h2>

<strong>In the morning</strong> I really concentrate on my first sip of water. I feel it across my tongue and travel down to my stomach. How the cold spreads across my chest. I truly try to appreciate that I am able to afford this drink and am able-bodied enough to lift it to my mouth.

I take just another moment to really feel grateful that all I needed to do was turn the tap and water filled my glass. I didn't have to fight for it or walk 3kms or even boil it first.

Try it for a week. You might surprise yourself.

Then, <strong>just before sleeping</strong>, I tend to rewind my day through my head and highlight about 3 things I'm grateful for that happened. They are not always 'big' things.

Remember, it's the small things that can be the most important.

For example, I might be grateful that we could afford a healthy dinner (and that my wife loves cooking healthy dinners ), or that I got a window seat on the train to the office, or that my house is still standing after the earthquake we had today.

What I'm trying to say is that you don't have to follow these articles plastered all over the Internet saying you have to do it <em>all the damn time</em>. Just take a little of your time each day to acknowledge just how lucky you are.

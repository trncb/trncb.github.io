We all interface with social media in one way or another. We like and share with our friends on Facebook, tweet on Twitter, or share our vintage photos on Instagram. There are a plethora of options for sharing ourselves and our views of the world on the Internet. But why is it that we still 'do' social media so wrong?

Because we don't <a href="http://helpgrowchange.com/interact">interact</a>. We don't engage enough. We don't <em>connect</em> with another.

Think about when you have a face-to-face conversation with a friend. They've come over to your place for a cup of coffee (or tea if that's your preference), and you two are chatting away.

Do you both talk at the same time - trying to shout over each other? I doubt it.
Do you just ignore a story of theirs, and carry on with your own? Nope.
Do you shout something at them, then get up and walk away without saying a word when they comment about it? <em>Of course not!</em>

Many of us are still coming to grips with how socia media is impacting our lives - and where it fits into our social spectrum. We still see these platforms as shouting boxes for people to see us and how awesome we are, but we don't take the time to <em>truly</em> connect with others online.

<h2>Make connections</h2>

I've been on Facebook since 2007, and I'm only now beginning to understand how to use it as a medium to connect and grow the relationships - almost like another means to get to know and understand them better.

It's about commenting on their status, showing empathy when it's needed, tagging them where necessary, or simply liking their posts.

The more you interact, the more meaningful your social media experience will be.

I've built some real connections online over the past few years. Friendships that have formed purely online across continents, people such as Jay, Brandon, or Annie. We interact fairly often, and I anticipate meeting them in person one day.

And as for the people I have met in person already, social media is another tool I can use to strengthen these relationships further.

<h2>It's all up to you</h2>

You need to think about why you want to be on social media. Do you just want to brag about your successes, shout out your opinion at anyone and everyone who might be interested? Are you online simply to spy on your family, friends, and acquaintances? (<em>I really hope you're not, that is just creepy and wrong</em>)

Or do you want to be a better person. The person who wants to really connect with their friends and family in a meaningful way. Keep it simple. Treat your special connections with extra attention. Add some personality to your posts. They will remember it, remember you.

Today, while you are browsing your Facebook or Twitter feeds, why not reply on someone's post and ask a question? Spark a conversation. You never know where it might lead.

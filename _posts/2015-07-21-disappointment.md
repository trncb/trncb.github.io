I recently took on a new role at my workplace. Through all my efforts in the previous role, I could not make the difference I wanted to.

For years, I tried. I attempted to organise movements, convince management, or influence certain decisions I knew would benefit the wider group. But I just couldn't get to the point of making the intended difference. And it has killed me.

Sometimes it is better to accept we cannot change a situation. We must accept failure and come back another day. We must realise when it's time to move on to something we <em>can</em> change.

It's crap. It's difficult. But it's the hard truth. People will only change when they are ready for change.

No matter how hard we hit their wall of resistance and indifference, we will not (<em>cannot</em>) bring it down. We cannot control the outcomes of their decisions, or convince them of the damage they are causing around them.

What we can control is how we react to their whims. We can control how we <a href="http://helpgrowchange.com/difference/">make a positive difference</a> to our own surroundings. Finally, we need to learn when to let go...

At the end of the day, we have to realise this is only business. Thankfully, we can take our influence, our skill, and our passion elsewhere. Somewhere where it might be better suited.

Don't give up the fight, just focus your energy in the right place.

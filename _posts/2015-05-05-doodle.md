I am endlessly testing new ideas in an attempt to see what works and what doesn't in many areas of my life. I've tried different methods for earning extra income. I've tried to better understand people through studying social psychology and neuro-linguistic programming. I've learnt to love better by reading marriage books.

Today, this article is about a new avenue I'm discovering. It involves doodling, being a dad, and sharing a message with more people. I would like to invite you to take a peek.

As you might know, I'm a firm believer of <a href="http://helpgrowchange.com/create/">creating something new</a> and <a href="http://helpgrowchange.com/action/">taking action</a>. Late last year, I rediscovered another passion of mine - drawing. Since I'm no good at any sort of fine art most people expect to see, I've been practising by simply doodling. Some of these are not half bad, and it was suggested I should sell them.

<em><strong>Crazy!</strong> Who would want to buy my doodles?</em>

But I did some research anyway, and found the quality of some pieces of work being sold out on the web are questionable. So, I took the plunge, braced myself for criticism, and <a href="" target="_blank">created a store</a> on Etsy.

Through <em>DoodlingDad</em>, I want my pieces to be simple, meaningful, and a little fun. My hope is for people to enjoy them when they look at them.

It would be awesome and fantastic if you can have a look, and let me know what you think. And if you really enjoy them, why not buy one for yourself?

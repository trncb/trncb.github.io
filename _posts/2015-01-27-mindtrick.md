We make decisions in everything we do. In the way we brush our teeth in the morning, when we decide to buy coffee, or where to sit on the train. Every single one of these decisions impacts our lives in ways we cannot imagine. Each decision moves us towards a destination we may, or may not, have set for ourselves. We need to make our decisions count.

So often, I see myself and others faltering on their decision making. Some folk make rash decisions (I'm guilty of this), while others find it difficult to make a decision on much of anything. We go about our lives rueing the decisions we've made - or not made.

So how do we change this? How do we become better decision makers? Well, there isn't much we can do, really. Yes, there are a plethora of options available, ranging from <em>gut feeling</em> to the <em>Kepner Tregoe Decision Making</em> process, but the trouble is we can't go about performing a problem analysis for every decision we make - especially if it a subconscious, sub-second one made in the spur of the moment. Neither can we simply go on gut feeling when the decision requires more thought. The trick is to find balance between the two.

One method that has worked for me is to focus <em>only</em> on the object of the decision. For example, I'm trying to make better decisions when I'm thirsty, specifically drinking water instead of Coca-Cola. I focus only on the area I want to change - drink water. I consciously bring that decision to the front of my mind when I'm thirsty, or every time it crosses my mind. I replace the thought with the object, like '<em>Water, water, water</em>', '<em>drink 2 litres of water a day</em>', or '<em>drink water now before you want something else, you lazy bastard!</em>'. I find the next time I am thirsty, I choose water instead of Coca-Cola.

This method has worked for me in other things too, such as; 
- exercising each morning (saying '<em>Drop and give me 20!</em>', instead of '<em>I'm tired</em>'), 
- focussing on tasks (saying '<em>Another one knocked off</em>', instead of '<em>I have so much to do!</em>'), 
- and even showing my family appreciation (saying '<em>These people are my foundation</em>', instead of '<em>Where is my time going?</em>').

Many decisions we make are due to habits we instil in ourselves. We've made these habits consistent enough to move to our sub-conscious. Once there, most of the decisions we make are automatic. Because we've made similar decisions before, our brains move the mental processing out of the way so that we can make these decisions quicker.

Changing these auto-decisions requires you to fuse new thought patterns and habits into your sub-conscious. No easy feat, but certainly possible. And it is easier than you think. It all starts with a little focus, and some habit forming.

What will you change about your decision making process today?

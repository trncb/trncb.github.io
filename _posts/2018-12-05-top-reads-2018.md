<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com">GoodReads</a>&nbsp;tells me I read over 40 books during 2018. Granted, only 16 of them were novels, the rest were graphic novels. But hey, if GoodReads says they're books,&nbsp; then I'll take it!&nbsp;</p>

<p>My reading journey through the year was quite a ride. I fought zombies, discovered the quantum multiverse, travelled to Alpha Centauri, then Hogwarts, returned to Middle Earth, hung out with Bear Grylls. I also found out why grizzly bears should wear underpants, and through all of that, I learnt how to focus more.<br></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=harry+potter">Harry Potter Series -<em>&nbsp;</em></a></strong><em><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=harry+potter">J.K. Rowling</a></strong></em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=harry+potter"> </a><br>Having never read the Harry Potter books, I thought I’d give it a go this year. They were <em>ok</em>. Nothing too inspiring. I only read the first 3 books in the series. I got bored and moved on. Each book seemed like much the same to me.<br></p>

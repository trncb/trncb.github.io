When was the last time you truly learnt something completely out of your comfort zone? A new skill that wasn&#39;t directly related to any of your current skills?

I haven&#39;t written anything new for a few weeks. Why? Because I&#39;ve been creating my own Wordpress theme for helpgrowchange.com. It&#39;s been a great journey of self-learning and something you could try out (the self-learning, not so much the development).

Maybe you want to understand the human mind better by learning about social psychology. Learn about a popular career choice such as digital marketing? Or maybe you&#39;d like to finally learn a new language.

But if learning is so awesome, why haven&#39;t we done it yet? Time. He is not our friend, right?

Well, the truth is, time won&#39;t open itself up for you - you have to <em>make</em> the time to learn. </p>

<blockquote>
&quot;Never stop learning, because life never stops teaching.&quot;</p></blockquote>

Cast your mind back to a time when you last learnt a new skill? Remember the feeling of satisfaction and triumph in realising you had now gained something new.

Bring back that feeling.

<h2 id="where-can-i-start?">Where can I start?</h2>

There are many, <em>many</em> online course websites offering a plethora of courses for free. Most of them are designed to make it easy for you to begin - no confusing entry or special multimedia requirements.

I&#39;ve mentioned in a <a href="https://helpgrowchange.com/continuously-learn/">previous article</a> about how I personally used Coursera to learn about business strategy and social psychology, and I have a few more courses added to my shortlist to learn soon.

If you&#39;re looking to learn development, one of the most popular learning sites is <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>. I started on that a while back, but other learning took priority (heh).

No matter what it is you&#39;re looking to learn, with a bit of effort you could probably find a beginner course online for free.

Hogwash.

People <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/08/12/inspiring-career-changes/#jqrQ81iWzsqb">change careers and jobs all the time</a>. The people in the article are prime examples of the change you can make for yourself if you continue to learn new skills. And they weren&#39;t in their twenties either.

<a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/24688/10-people-who-switched-careers-after-50-and-thrived">Here is a random Google search</a> of 10 people who changed careers when they were over 50 years of age.

You&#39;re <em>never</em> too old to learn. What will you learn today?

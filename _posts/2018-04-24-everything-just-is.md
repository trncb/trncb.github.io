Time, movement of the planets, our daily lives. It all just happens whether we want it to or not.

No matter what we do, no matter how hard we try, the sun will rise tomorrow, the rain will fall.

Why, then, do we make our lives so difficult by being vindictive, vengeful, and angry?

Since we can't change the progression of our lives (mostly), let's focus of making life <em>better</em>.

Patience, kindness, compassion. Let's bring more of that shit our way.

Wouldn't life be so much better if we all treated each other better?

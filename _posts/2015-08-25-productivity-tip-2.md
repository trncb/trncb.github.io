Ever had the feeling where you have had such a productive day? A day in which you believe your time was utilised as efficiently as possible? An amazing feeling isn't it? I bet those days are few and far between.

The reality is more likely that most days you find yourself snowed under. You are reactively attending to tasks and feel scattered all over the place. Because of this, you are not getting much done at all. You feel despondent, demotivated, and become even less productive. And so the cycle goes...

In my <a href="http://helpgrowchange.com/maketime/">Productivity Tip #1</a> article, I stressed the fact that you have to make time to manage time. My second tip (and this article) is along the same vein, but it's about applying focus at a higher level (in-between the scurry of our day-to-day tasks).

It doesn't involve dumping your workload on someone else, or throwing your laptop in the bin. It is about scheduling your tasks so you can focus on one at a time.

<h2>Our brains get tired too</h2>

Like you, I have a crapload of things going through my brain at any one time. I'm thinking about the tasks I need to do today, and what I need to do after that. I'm reminding myself I must pay the gas bill before Thursday, and I need to publish this very article tonight.

It's exhausting. Our brains are wonderful miracles, but it can only do so much - especially after constantly being pushed to the limit. Our brain is a muscle, and like any other muscle, it needs rest too.

In order to do this, we need to move some of the tasks we <em>actively think about</em> into 'autopilot'. The autopilot is our sub-conscious, allowing a whole range of habits and behaviours to occur without using much brain power. How do we do this? It's as simply as setting a schedule.

I have a fulltime job, yet I still need to write new content for this blog, be a family man, learn new things, and enjoy life. Last year, this was a nightmare to maintain. If I didn't do something one day, I'd feel anxious that I had missed it. I constantly felt under pressure to be doing <em>something</em>.

I felt I was missing out or being lazy. It eventually got to the point where I stopped blogging for a while.

<h2>Set aside time for specific tasks</h2>

Then I came across a workbook suggesting to set aside certain days for certain activities. I did exactly that, and what happened next was amazing. I no longer had to worry that no writing was being done - as I knew it was planned for Monday. I no longer had to feel bad if I didn't go for a run, as I knew it Saturday was run day.

The simple matter of setting a day of the week to focus on one task (other than all the usual day-to-day grind) really eliminates the background nagging in my mind. I can remind it to shut the hell up and I'll deal with the said task on the allocated day.

If you are struggling to keep up with <em>all</em>Â your life tasks. Try setting particular days for certain tasks. For example, here is mine;

<ul>
    <li>Monday: Article day (write articles, plan new article ideas, prepare this week's article).</li>
    <li>Tuesday: General blog/home tasks (budget, ideas, research, etc)</li>
    <li>Wednesday: Watch at least one TED Talk.</li>
    <li>Thursday: Learning day (Go through study material if I'm on a course, or read a self-study book).</li>
    <li>Friday: Finish off any other little items.</li>
    <li>Saturday: Run day (run further than 5km).</li>
    <li>Sunday: Rest day.</li>
</ul>

Why not set a simple schedule such as this? You won't be disappointed.

<blockquote>
  "Money makes the world go round"
</blockquote>

My mother taught me this saying, and in today's society it still rings true. We rely on it for almost everything. We use it to buy our food, pay for our power and Internet services, and even need money to clothe ourselves. We work our asses off for decades in the hope that we will still have enough money to live once we are not able to work any more. As a society we focus too much on money itself and it's necessity in our lives.

<p style="color: #FF6600;"><b><em>Although money can make the world go round, it is not the only one that does.</em></b></p>

We have come to believe that money is the only thing that will make us happy, and that we need it to ensure our future happiness and success. This cannot be further from the truth. Don't get me wrong, there is a certain amount of funding we need in order to survive, but that is all money is for. It is the end result of the focus you have put in elsewhere, and not the focus itself.

I strongly believe there are 3 other principles in life where we should (<em>and must</em>) focus on. <strong>Kindness</strong>, <strong>Respect</strong>, and <strong>Giving</strong>. All three are intertwined and essential to building a fulfilled life.

<h2>Kindness starts with a smile</h2>

Being kind is real easy, almost too easy. When we think of kindess, we envisage soft-hearted people with puppy dog eyes, not saying a bad word to anyone. It doesn't have to be like that, and all you have to do to start off being kind is a simple smile to another person. Not one of those creepy, stalker smiles, but a genuine one. Something that will make them feel better in their day because of it. You can smile anywhere and at anyone, such as at the cashier in the store, or the person walking past you in the street.

One simple smile can really change a person's day.

<h2>Respect builds trust</h2>

I cannot stress the importance of respect. Respecting others' beliefs, their privacy, and their time are only a few examples of what to do. Because you believe in something, or are comfortable with stating your opinion, does not give you the right to disrespect those around you. One thing I try to do here, is <a href="http://helpgrowchange.com/shoes/">put myself in their shoes</a>. This normally helps me catch myself before I show too much disrespect and break down the relationship I've worked hard to build.

<h2>Giving helps you feel better</h2>

More studies show that when we help others with their successes, we feel many times greater satisfaction than if we simply helped ourselves. <em>Giving</em> is about selflessly helping someone else with something instead of for yourself. Give your partner the last chocolate in the box because you know it's their favourite. Help a friend with some groceries that they can't afford, or donate a large sum of money to a charity you believe in.

<h2>BONUS principle - Gratitude</h2>

How can we be happy and content about anything if we don't appreciate what we have? I look at my sons every day, and am so grateful they are healthy and beautiful. I thank my lucky stars for having such a supportive wife. My appreciation is through the roof when I am able to afford the pleasures in life (like electricity, Internet, and a choice of food) when there are children working in glass factories or roaming the streets for rubbish, hoping to sell them to recycling centres (<em>if you know how I can help them, I would love to know!</em>).

Take a minute out of your day to realise the world you're in. Is your 9-5, well-paying, job really that bad? Do you really need to get irritated at the red traffic light when you're sitting in your 5 year old car?

<h2>No-one is perfect, and that's ok</h2>

I'm still learning how to fully integrate these core principles into my life. Sometimes, I'm still a bit selfish, don't show enough respect, and am sometimes unkind. Don't take it too personally when you don't get it right, as long as you <em>know</em> you did wrong. Just remember to be <a href="http://helpgrowchange.com/yesterday/">better next time</a>.

All three of these principles are so critical, so integral that without them we will live hollow, shallow, mediocre lives. Yes, money is important, it can buy us many <em>things</em>, but it doesn't make this world a better place on it's own. Through kindness, giving, and respect, money can be used to make the difference we want and need it to make.

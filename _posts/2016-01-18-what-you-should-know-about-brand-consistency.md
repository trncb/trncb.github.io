<span style="font-weight: 400;">Brand consistency sounds an awful lot like one of those marketing buzzwords that everyone </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">needs</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to do now and it will make you tons of money. No, brand consistency is not about that. It’s about building trust with your customers, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">consistently </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">displaying your brand in such a way, that they will learn to know and love you. And yes, continue doing business with you.</span>

<h3>But what is brand consistency?</h3>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a number of factors combined across all your business mediums so your customers can know and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">trust</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your brand - whether they are looking at your website, newsletter, business cards, brochures...whatever, wherever.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a few moments to think about Apple, Google, Microsoft. Think carefully about the </span><b>experience</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you feel when you’re reading their material. Have a look at their advertising, read their website. They have invested </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a lot</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of money to ensure a consistent experience to their customers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you see something belonging to one of these brands, you instantly know it’s them.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s what you want your customers to do with you and your brand. I sure want my customers (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly you</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) to know me that well!</span>

<h3>How can I build brand consistency?</h3>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintain the boring. Yep, it’s as simple as that. Types of fonts and colours are the easiest to start off with, then it works up to tone, positioning and overall design.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, brand consistency is about showing our thoughtfulness, professionalism, and that we know what we’re talking about. It doesn’t look that way when there are 3 different fonts and sizes on 3 different pages on your website. Or, when you have your own domain name, yet insist on using a gmail address for people to contact you. You own a domain name, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">use it</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Note: If you don’t have a domain name, they are not expensive, and if you’re running a business, it should be able to afford the $15 a year (<a href="http://trnc.co/go/iwantmyname/" target="_blank">you can register one here</a>).</span></em></p>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The subconscious impression our customers get from these small inconsistencies is that we are not professional. We may be the best in the world at what we do, but we’re losing customers when we are not consistent. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The next company along the line with more consistency </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">appears</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more professional, and in turn, </span><b>will get our business</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I don’t want that to happen. It’s just not right.</span>

<b>So, look at (and fix) these items immediately!</b>

<ol>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Email address consistent with your domain name (use yourawesome</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">email@yourawesomedomain.com</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> instead of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">notgoodforbusiness@gmail.com</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colours and fonts across your website.</span></li>
</ol>

<h3>Look at your brand’s bigger picture</h3>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Going beyond your website, have a look at your newsletter, your brochures, your business card. Are they displaying a consistent brand? Will your customers know it’s you when they see any of these mediums?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It might not seem like it, but these factors are </span><b>extremely important</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Again, think of Apple, Google, and Microsoft. They have invested millions of dollars in this for a reason.</span>

<h3>Brand consistency indirectly sells for you</h3>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yep, by being consistent throughout your brand, you are subconsciously imprinting your brand into your customers’ minds. They learn to </span><b>trust you</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>people buy from who they trust</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll leave you with that thought, and if you want some further help with building trust with your customers, <a href="http://trnc.co/#contactus">give me a shout</a>. Let’s build something together. </span>

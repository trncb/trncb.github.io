While cleaning out my garage a week ago, I started thinking - not just about how much crap I have - but also about human ingenuity in general. Take the humble household garage as an example.

Us humans have an interesting history with garages. We use it as our spare bedroom, a storeroom to hold stuff for 'one day' in the future, or a playroom for the piles of kids toys.

We use it as a workshop to build or repair things. We run our businesses out of it - whether that be printing, crafts, or a beauty parlour. Or even a games room for those awesome social evenings.

These are just a few of the uses we have come up with for the simple garage. Here's another novel idea; I think I might just <em>park my car</em> in there.

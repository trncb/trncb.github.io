Best. Workflow. <strong>Ever.</strong>

This workflow is printed out and posted on the wall right above my screen at work. It serves as a regular reminder of how to approach any situation in which you might be worried about.

It's so simple and so true. Although sometimes, it's sure as hell not easy.

Ask yourself the questions from the workflow and every one of them will end up with you not having to worry.

Since you've now freed up some anxious energy, have a <em>great</em> day.

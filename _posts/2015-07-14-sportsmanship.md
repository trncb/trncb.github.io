We live in an extremely competitive world. We compete against somebody almost every minute of each day. We compete in how many tasks we do in a day, how fast we can run, or even how much money we make in a year. There is nothing wrong with some healthy competition, there is something wrong when people disrespect their competitors.

I'm a huge believer in sportsmanship. It is about playing the game, giving your best, and still respecting your competitors. Whether you win or lose, you have to acknowledge how well your competitor did.

The best example of this is through sport, such as rugby. Tackle after gruelling tackle, two teams absolutely smash eachother during a game. Yet, when it's all over, they shake hands and start chatting like long lost friends (particularly in New Zealand).

Another great example of sportsmanship was in the Cricket World Cup 2015 semifinal, in which New Zealand batsman, Grant Elliot, smashed the ball to win the game. The South African bowler, Dale Steyn, crumpled to the ground in defeat. What did Elliot do? Instead of celebrating wildly and running to his team mates, he went over to Steyn, helped him up, and showed respect for a game well played. It still gives me goosebumps remembering it.

You can be the same in your day-to-day dealings. There is no reason to leave people in the dirt when you are successful. There is no reason to sabotage someone else's career because you're jealous of their success.

<strong>You are better than that.</strong>

I believe we should be comfortable in our own abilities, compete against ourselves, and continually strive to be <a href="http://helpgrowchange.com/yesterday/">better than before</a>. We need to acknowledge the strengths of people we are competing with - admire them even.

Think about an activity you are busy with in which you're competing with someone. Are you putting them down? <em>How about urging them on?</em> Are you wishing ill on them? <em>Why not wish them the best?</em> Are you mocking their weaknesses? <em>Have you analysed your own? (Yes, you do have weaknesses)</em>

Congratulate your competitors when they win, respect them when they lose. Be competitive. Win the game. Just don't be a dick about it.

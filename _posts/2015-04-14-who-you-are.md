It is human nature that drives us to be people-pleasers. We want other people to like us. We want them to call us when they're lonely, or even when they're not. We want them to <em>want</em> to be with us. But to meet the demand of being liked, sometimes we change ourselves to appear as something we are not. We deny our true selves the chance to connect with the right people for us, because we're trying to impress the wrong people.

I am guilty of giving up who I am to impress other people - with the only goal to appear as if I'm 'good enough' to associate with them. I would be a kind-hearted partner to my wife, then while out with my friends, I would snub my nose to a person asking for a couple dollars on the street. Looking back now, I shake my head disappointingly at myself.

The sad thing is, is this behaviour is not uncommon across all of our modern day society. We are pulled in every direction by our friends, advertising, work, social media, pretty much anything else really. An illusion appears in each of these directions we're pulled in. The illusion that we could be a better person if we simply change to fit the mould. Don't get taken in by the mirage. I believe this is where we lose ourselves more because we are trying to be somebody we are not.

We need to be content with who we are. The right people will then be attracted to us. If we are comfortable with our values, strengths, weaknesses, likes and dislikes, we will choose the right path for <em>ourselves</em>. Not the path where we chase friends or dreams we 'think' is right, the path is the one we <em>know</em> is right.

<strong>How do you know you are content with yourself?</strong>

<ul>
<li>You are not worried about the outcome. </li>
<li>No matter what happens, you know you tried your best. </li>
<li>You made the choice because you felt it in your gut. </li>
<li>You are comfortable speaking your mind. </li>
<li>You don't care what others think because you stayed true to yourself.</li>
</ul>

<strong>How do you know you are losing yourself?</strong>

<ul>
<li>You feel like you are being forced into a situation. </li>
<li>You don't agree with the morals or values of a situation, but you do it anyway. </li>
<li>You don't speak you honest opinion because you are afraid it might cause a stir.</li>
</ul>

So often do I find myself <em>still</em> making decisions to please the people I associate with. But I find I'm only compromising for the small stuff, like opinions on movies or social activities. When it comes to the more important decisions impacting on my values, morals, and beliefs, this is where I stand strong. No matter what the outcome, I want to know that I've stayed true to who I really am. It is the best feeling when I go to bed at night knowing that I've done the right thing today.

How do you feel you are when it comes to staying true to yourself? Are you listening to your inner core, or trying to impress others?

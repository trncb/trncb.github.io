The answer is not 'out there', it's here. In your heart and mind.

The self-help and motivational industries are massive at the moment. Money is flowing everywhere. Why? Because people like you and me want to be better people and live better lives.

But if there is so much available to us why aren't we all super-motivated and taking over the world?  Because many of us don't see the truth.

Change starts with us.

We can read as many books as we'd like. We can spend thousands on life coaches and therapists. We can create herbal and medicinal concoctions to make us feel better.

But ultimately it comes down to us.

<em>We</em> decide to make a change.
<em>We</em> take the action to be better people.
<em>We</em> determine how much effort to put in. 
<em>We</em> make our own lives what we want it to be.

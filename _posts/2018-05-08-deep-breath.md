In...out.

In...

Out...

That's all it takes to avoid anger and potentially making a bad situation worse.

A little while ago I found myself getting irritated with many little things. Things that didn't warrant getting all riled up over like containers not packed away correctly, something not working when it should be, or my kids not doing a task the very second I asked them to. Stupid little things.

It was affecting me, my family, and our general happiness. After the realisation of me <a href="https://trnc.co/a/look-at-me-the-hypocrite/">being a hypocrite</a> I am trying out something new which works surprisingly well in many situations.

A new-age, totally unheard of, you-would-never-believe-it action.

A single deep breath.

Looking down at your feet while walking is not conducive to assessing where you are going, how far you still need to go, and what the best route will be.

The same applies to how you walk through life. <!--more--> Let me explain.

Picture yourself walking down a street. Any street you wish. This street is your life, with crossing streets to navigate, other pedestrians to bypass, and obstacles on the sidewalk to avoid.

<h2>Where are you going</h2>

While you're looking down at your feet with your earphones in, you can't see where your end goal is. You walk here and you walk there, randomly following the sidewalk down side streets and paths. You have no concept of where you are or where you need to be. Lift your head...

<h2>How far to go</h2>

You have no idea how far your next destination is. You keep walking and walking, but the end just isn't coming. Look up...

<h2>What obstacles are there</h2>

You're randomly walking down this street with no direction, and no clue on the remaining distance. You constantly surprised by unexpected obstacles. A pole seen at the last minute. Walking into another pedestrian. Having to cross another side street. Raise your chin...

<h2>Look to the next obstacle and beyond</h2>

Looking up and being aware of your destination enables you to see the path ahead. By seeing the path ahead, you can navigate all obstacles set in your way. You can preempt where other pedestrians are going to be. You can cross side streets without worry. You know where you're going, and therefore don't detour down streets not meant for you.

Of course these side streets are good points for you to assess whether you want to continue on your current path, but that is a post for another day.

At the end of the day what I'm trying to suggest is : How can you get where you want to go if you're not looking up and assessing the path that you need to travel?

Rather than obsessing with what's at your feet, step over it and continue.

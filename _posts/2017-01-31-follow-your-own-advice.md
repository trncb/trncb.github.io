Every 2nd post I see on Facebook or Twitter is about self-advice. Articles and headlines such as &quot;5 things for a better 2017&quot;, &quot;Be kind&quot;, &quot;13 things to stop doing to achieve greatness&quot; clutter my newsfeed.

At first, I think <em>Wow, so many people are bettering themselves</em>. And then 2 minutes later they&#039;re posting crap again, or carrying on with their lives while <em>not changing a thing</em>.

How is your life going to get any better if you don&#039;t change anything?

<blockquote>
&quot;Nothing changes if nothing changes.&quot;</p></blockquote>

<em>(Best. Quote. <strong>Ever.</strong>)</em>

What seems to happen is people read these fanciful quotes and smile at some or other inspirational picture, have a brief thought about &quot;yeah that&#039;s nice&quot;, and then <em>they do nothing</em>.

Nothing at all.

The next day they&#039;re complaining about some crap in their lives that they wouldn&#039;t be complaining about <em>if they followed their own advice</em> - the advice they shared on social media <em>just yesterday</em>.

Stand by what you say and put it out to the world.

Take control of your life.

Decide to make the change and own it till it&#039;s done.<br />
(Or at least own up when you change tact again, but that's a whole other post.)

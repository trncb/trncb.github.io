I'm sure you've noticed how many people wear headphones during the day - you might be one of them yourself. There are headphone-wearers on the street, on the train, walking around the office, sitting on the couch at home. These folks shut themselves off from the world around them and I'd love to know why.

Why wouldn't you want to hear the rain falling around you? Doesn't it bring a smile when you hear laughter from a passing conversation? What about birdsong or the general bustle of the city around you? (Nevermind the danger factor - random articles <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11902399">[1]</a> and <a href="https://www.lawm-b.com/blog/2017/04/key-statistics-about-pedestrians-headphones-and-accidents.shtml">[2]</a>)

I wear headphones, sure, but there is a time and place for them. Like focusing in an open plan office, or just a bit of background music on the early morning train.

Overall, I'm comfortable with silence and my own thoughts. Are you?

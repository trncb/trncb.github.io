<p>I didn't wish anyone Merry Christmas this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I only realised this on Boxing Day and, well, that was a bit late to send anything out. Obviously, I responded to any wishes I received. I just didn't sent anything out on my own accord.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Initially, I felt bad about this. I mean, who doesn't send any Christmas wishes? <em>Me, that's who</em>. But then I realised...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I spent Christmas with the people closest to me - my family. There was no need to send out messages across the world or to random people over social media. I had what I wanted and needed right in front of me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Did I think of anyone else? Of <g class="gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="7" data-gr-id="7">course</g> I did. My parents, my siblings, my close friends, even my work colleagues. I was hoping they were having just as great a time as I was. I just didn't send them any messages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Does that make me a bad person? I don't think so. I'm deeply grateful for who I have in my life. But I don't feel this justifies sending messages just one time of the year. The people important to me know who they are and it's the relationship we have throughout the year that counts - not messages during the holidays.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, if you didn't get any Seasons Greetings from me, don't be angry or sad. <strong>Nobody did.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh, and I hope you have a very merry Christmas and a happy New Year.</p>

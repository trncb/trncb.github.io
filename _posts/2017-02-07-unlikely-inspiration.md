Although I aspire to be an inspiration, try to help people solve their problems and write articles for this blog, it&#039;s just weird (and extremely humbling) when I hear how I am looked to for inspiration or guidance.

I&#039;m just a guy trying my best to be the best I can be. I don&#039;t expect adoring fans or monetary donations or my name to be tattooed across butt cheeks. I just want to help.

It brings me great joy seeing the smile on someone&#039;s face after they&#039;ve taken up a suggestion I made. It is fantastic to see how they find life just a bit easier, or are making a difference because of a conversation we had.

But it&#039;s not just about seeing what I&#039;ve had a hand in, it&#039;s about helping others and how happy they are.

<strong>Helping others helps you</strong>

There is a TED talk by Michael Norton (<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/michael_norton_how_to_buy_happiness">watch it here</a>) in which he talks about a study conducted around how you can buy happiness.

The study gave a little money to a number of people and asked them to spend it on themselves or spend it on someone else. After all sorts of measurements, it was found that when the subjects spent the money on someone else, they were &#039;happier&#039;.

This is how I feel when helping you.

Thank you for having faith in me. Thank you for trusting in me enough to want to improve your life.

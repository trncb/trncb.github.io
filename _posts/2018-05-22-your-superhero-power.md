What would your superhero power be? Mine, without a shadow of a doubt, would be the power of flight.

The freedom of the entire sky at my feet. How awesome must that feeling be...<em>sigh</em>.

But you know what? You don't need superhero powers to save the world.

The world needs only you. Just you.

I'm not talking about jumping-into-a-burning-building type help. This is more about the small stuff. Helping one person is being a superhero. That tiny bit of help, whatever it may be, goes a long way.

It might be helping someone with directions, donating blood, opening a door when someone has their hands full, picking someone up after they've tripped, listening to someone's life troubles. The list goes on and on.

They will be grateful for your help. It makes their day better and you feel good too.

Carry on being awesome. Be your own superhero.

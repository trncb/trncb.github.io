The logo of your brand is not important. There, I said it. It can feel frustrating when you don’t have one. It feels, somehow, incomplete. You think that because the logo is the first thing people see, it’s the most important aspect to focus on.

<strong>It’s not.</strong>

This was a hard lesson I had to learn. Whenever I started on something new, I thought to myself ‘I must design the logo now!’, and I would go off and focus on that <em>rather than the actual product</em>.

The effort would only end in frustration. I had a pretty logo and not much else.

<strong>What is a logo anyway?</strong> It’s just a feature, not a driving force behind your brand or the business you will get from it. There is the exception, of course, if you’re a multi-million dollar <em>recognisable</em> brand (They’ve gone through many years and iterations of their logos anyway).

How many times have you purchased a product or service from someone who didn’t have a logo? I’ll bet it was several times. I’ll go one step further and claim you used some of those people more than once.

I’ve worked with plenty of people who have no logo (even some international 6-figure earners), which certainly proves the point to me that it’s not all about the logo.

It may have been a local plumber or market stall or even a lawyer, the fact is we are not looking at logos and deciding on whether we like the business. We decide to do business with them because of how we felt about their products or services.

Similarly, there is no need for you to worry about your own logo. <strong>A logo does not make a brand.</strong>

Having said that, it doesn’t hurt to have a logo. An image people can associate with your brand, your product, and your quality. It should be an extension of who you are, what your company is about, and what image you want to portray.

But before you go running off to create one, just remember that some of the best business you may have previously done was with someone who didn’t have a logo…

<strong>Focus on developing a quality product first (that people are actually buying). <em>Then</em> think about the image you want to portray.</strong>

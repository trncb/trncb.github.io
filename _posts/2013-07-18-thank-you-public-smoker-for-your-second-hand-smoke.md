Dear Public Smoker

I know you have chosen to smoke tobacco for whatever reason. But can you please refrain from forcing your second-hand smoke on me, and my fellow non-smokers. You are causing disease, disability, and death. <!--more--> You most definitely have the right to choose to smoke. And I have no issue with you doing so in your own home or in a designated public place.

However, for those of us who have chosen not to smoke, our health is being detrimentally affected by you, and your disregard for the health of those around you.

I hear you saying “I choose to smoke. I know the health risks. I’m the one dying, not you”. Wrong.

Picture this - you’re strolling down the street puffing away merrily. You take a nice drag, and exhale. Have you ever thought what happens to that second-hand smoke once it leaves your mouth? Or the smoke coming from the cigarette you’re holding?

Straight into the lungs of the chump behind you. In other words, me.

There are a plethora of stats that show second-hand smoke is just as bad, if not worse than, directly smoking tobacco. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_smoking">Here</a>, <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/secondhand_smoke/general_facts/">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/tobaccocancer/secondhand-smoke">here</a>, are but a few examples.

So please, next time you debate striking up your next cigarette on the street, take a moment to consider those around you. Me, your friends, <em>your children</em>.

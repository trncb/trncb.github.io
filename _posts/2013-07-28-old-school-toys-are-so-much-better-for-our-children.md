All those flashy, bleeping, blinking, and [not-so]cheap toys should be thrown out the window. Forever. They inhibit imagination, innovation, and the learning of integral abilities that benefit our children later on in life. Old-school-type toys such as building blocks, wooden train tracks, and solid animals, are *a lot *better.

My two sons are currently of toddler age (yes, it’s a busy home) and I see the benefit of having these toys everyday. Building blocks are built differently <em>everytime</em>. Train tracks run a different route <em>everytime</em>. The animals have all sorts of conversations and do all manner of things that they were not intended for. All this, due to the imagination afforded to my boys by not being entranced and zombified by the flashing lights and tinny sound effects.

Don’t get me wrong, there are some flashing, blinking toys that are quite fantastic. But these are generally the ones that don’t have one syllable, or one monotonous motion. They enhance the playing experience.

There are many opinions and studies which support this theory that the ‘classic’ toys are better for our children, with some of the benefits being:

<ul>
<li>Improving the fine and gross motor skills,</li>
<li>Imaginative play,</li>
<li>Problem solving and puzzle skills,</li>
<li>and Creativity. </li>
</ul>

Even though my boys don’t have as many toys as some of their friends, it makes me genuinely happy when they are using their magnificently imaginative minds to create a new world every time they play.

My wife, Lisa, wanted to bring her wonderful handcrafted creations to the world and sell them online.

The <a href="https://shefeltcrafty.com" target="_blank">She Felt Crafty</a> name was born and we worked together for a few months on her logo, website, and other marketing material.

We clambered out the other end of the journey with a clean, cute, and homely brand that we felt customers would love interacting with.

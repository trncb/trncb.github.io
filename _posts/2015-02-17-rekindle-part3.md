This is the third and final instalment of my series about how you can rekindle your passion on a lazy Sunday afternoon.

In the <a href="http://helpgrowchange.com/rekindle-part1/">first part</a> I challenged you to dream about a day in your future life. A day about 3-5 years in the future which is the culmination of your life dreams today. In <a href="http://helpgrowchange.com/rekindle-part2/">Part 2</a> I encouraged you to draw out the details of your dream, as well as to discover why you want to achieve this dream.

As a recap here are the 5 questions listed before;

<ul>
<li>What is my dream?</li>
<li>Why do I want this?</li>
<li>What do I want to achieve?</li>
<li>What can I offer?</li>
<li>What can I do?</li>
</ul>

Of the five questions I pointed out previously, you answered two of them - <em>What is the dream?</em> and <em>Why do I want this?</em>. Out of these two, you gained <strong><em>purpose</em></strong>.

With purpose we can go anywhere and do anything. But how? Well, that's where the trick comes in. We have to move out of our dream world and actually perform some work. This is tough, but once you get going it's not too hard.

Let's find out how...

<h2>What do I want to achieve?</h2>

Although this may sound similar to '<em>what is the dream?</em>', in truth it is far from it. Our dream state elicits feelings and inspiration, while achievements are the tangible outcomes based on the dream. For example, in my own dream, I am walking to my son's school to pick him up. The achievement is that I am working from home to allow myself the flexibility to take a walk when I want.

<h2>What can I offer and What can I do?</h2>

The remaining two questions go hand-in-hand where the focus is around performing an honest appraisal of yourself to see what you can offer yourself to reach your dream. Maybe include someone you trust to offer you honest feedback.

Compile a list of strengths, weaknesses, skill sets, and experience. Think of these answers as the tools you have available to work towards your dream. By laying them all out on the table, you can see what you have and more importantly, <em>what you are missing</em>.

<h2>Now is the time for action</h2>

You have your dream, you have your purpose, and you have a view of where you stand right now. Now go for it! When I reached this point, I was raring to go. Excited that I had finally realised what I wanted, why I wanted it, and what I could do to get there.

The next part of your journey is the hardest - taking the first step towards the dream. <em>What will your first step be?</em>

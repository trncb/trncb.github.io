What does it mean to &#39;limit one&#39;s career&#39;? Why are there preconceived ideas about what we &#39;should&#39; be doing to progress our careers? Where is this unspoken ladder we talk about, and where can I break it?

Between 2010 and 2016 my career was a bit of a rollercoaster ride. I went from database administrator to team leader to service manager to team leader of another 2 teams, then Service Delivery Manager, back to team leader, and finally to middleware administrator.

Phew.

After about 6 months in each role, I started getting itchy feet again and searched for the next challenge. I gained a reputation among my colleagues on when I&#39;d be moving next. It&#39;s funny, but not funny at the same time.

My latest role of Middleware Administrator is a technical role again. It&#39;s been 9 months now and I <em>still</em> enjoy working on anything I can get my hands on. I&#39;ve found true joy in my job (which is rare for many people) and I don&#39;t foresee any role-hopping in the near future.</p>

<h2 id="what-people-think">What people think</h2>

In the eyes of many people I&#39;ve spoken to, though, they see this as a &#39;demotion&#39; of some sort and a step backwards in my career. &quot;Why would you go back to technical?&quot; is a common question I get from them.

<em>To add some context, in I.T. a technical role is lowest on the corporate food chain.</em>

I can feel their confusion (and sometimes disdain) about why I went back to technical. I can feel them thinking <em>he&#39;s taken a step back in his career</em> or <em>he&#39;s taken the easy road</em>.

Does it <em>really</em> matter how successful someone is? Does it really matter how high up in the corporate ladder we are? Does it really matter how much money is in our paycheck?

I don&#39;t believe it does matter. And, deep down, neither do you.

We talk about this all the time. We complain about our unhappiness in our job. We describe how we&#39;re under strain due to the extra pressures of managing a team or client. We <em>live for the weekend</em>, dreaming Friday can&#39;t come soon enough.

Why?!

Why do we put ourselves through this day in and day out - because we were told it&#39;s what we should do? It&#39;s completely ludicrous.

<h2 id="what-do-you-want-to-do?">What do you want to do?</h2>

The big question is: Would you rather be the head honcho, or be <em>happy</em> in your role?

I&#39;m certainly not telling you to &#39;follow your heart and fly with the birds&#39;. That&#39;s just as bad. For me, I still work Monday to Friday - the difference is I <em>want to</em> and I&#39;m happy.

We spend 80% of our lives working in a job. We may as well make it count, right?

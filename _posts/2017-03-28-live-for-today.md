How much time do you think you have left in your life? How much time will we spend with our partner or our children? It won&#39;t be nearly as much as you think. It might feel like forever and &#39;<em>tomorrow&#39;s another day</em>&#39;. But what if tomorrow isn&#39;t another day?

Today is all you have. Right here, right now.

Tomorrow you could slip and crack your head on the pavement, be diagnosed with cancer, or be run over by a terrorist. You just don&#39;t know what could happen.

The thought is frightening and scary, but what are you going to do about it? And no, locking you and your family up at home while eliminating all safety hazards is not the answer. If it is your time to go, it&#39;s your time to go.

You can&#39;t stop Death&#39;s selection process - the Final Destination movie series proved that. Jokes aside, there are too many factors you can&#39;t control in ensuring your lifespan. You will fret, worry, and stress yourself to the point of no return. And what will you get in the end? Yourself, six feet under.

Whether you&#39;re 26 or 86, we all end up in the same place. So why waste time worrying?

Seriously, it&#39;s as simple as that. Is it easy? Shit, no.

I struggle with comprehending this truth. It&#39;s so easy to forget just how fickle and fragile we are. I get irritated with my children. I forget to tell my wife how beautiful she looks and how I appreciate her support. Why? Because there will be time for that &#39;later&#39;.

I forget that &#39;Later&#39; might never arrive.

It&#39;s time to stop fretting about the future and appreciate what we have today. Plan what you can, but don&#39;t <em>worry</em> so much. Because all you can control is right here in front of you - your family, your children, your friends, your happiness.

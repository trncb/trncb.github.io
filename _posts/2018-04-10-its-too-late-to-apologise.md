Actually, no it's not. It's never too late to say you're sorry.

You might not get forgiveness or an immediate reprieve. But the fact that you have admitted fault and are genuine in your admittance goes a long way to that remediation.

Are you genuinely sorry for something you said or done? Have you apologised for it? It doesn't matter if you think the other person knows you're sorry, or that the situation feels like it's smoothed over, just apologise for it.

I don't know how many times I've said I'm sorry. But, even just for my own state of mind, I own up and apologise for the actions I've done. It's a place to begin building the bridge to forgiveness.

Try it.

Be the better person.

Make the hard choice and own it.

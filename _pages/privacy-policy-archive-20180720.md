<h2>Date archived: 20 July 2018</h2>

The simple act of visiting a website leaves a trail of information, a “digital footprint,” about visitors like you. Sometimes this footprint is vague and preserves your anonymity and other times it is tied specifically to you and your real life identity.

If all you do is click around and read pages, the data captured about you is vague. If you leave a comment or sign up for a newsletter, the data captured about you is sometimes very specific. Almost all web sites on the web today collect data in this fashion about visitors, and this site is no different.

It is our belief that you deserve to know how we handle your information. Consequently, the Privacy Policy below is a disclosure concerning our intent with your data. It is not a legally binding contract. It is a statement of intent made in good faith.

If you are unsure what something means, please ask. Contact information is available at the bottom of the Privacy Policy.

<h3>Usage</h3>

Data is used for the express purpose of enabling you to read, respond to, and discover published content topical to this site, and nothing else.

<h3>Duration</h3>

Data may be kept indefinitely.

<h3>Commerce</h3>

Data is never bartered or sold for commercial gain.

<h3>Analytic</h3>

Data may be collected by analytic services.

<h3>Contact</h3>

If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact the site owner by emailing<strong> myprivacy (at) trnc (dot) co</strong> .

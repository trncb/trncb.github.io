<p>This manifesto has been written to remind me of <strong>why</strong> I continue to write on this blog. I tend to go off on a tangent quite often and it is my ‘reminder system’ of what I am trying to achieve in my life. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a way, this manifesto is also my promise to you with regards to what you can get from reading this humble blog.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, I want to keep this blog <strong>simple</strong>. No frills. No wild claims. Just easy reading - written from the heart.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m hopeful of a brighter future for you and I, and this blog is my way of making a difference towards that future. A way to solidify my beliefs, challenge your way of thinking, and possibly even plant a seed that will benefit you in some way.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These articles will be written from the heart - no BS like <em>‘3 reasons to…’</em> or <em>‘Why you need …’</em> or some other random shit in which I’ve fallen trap to previously.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The frequency of my posts might not be regular - this is one of the things that threw me off many times before. Consistency is key is some respects, but I find it sometimes affects the quality of my articles.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My views will change. Often. As I continue to grow, so too will my view on certain topics. We cannot be expected to stay the same throughout our lives. Otherwise, we would <strong>stagnate</strong> - and that is as good as a slow death.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thank you for reading this far. I am truly grateful. I hope I can help you in some way today.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Warm Regards,<br>Terence</p>

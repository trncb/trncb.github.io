Here’s a little blurb of who I am and where I come from. If you’re interested in contacting me further, feel free to connect through <a href="https://twitter.com/trncb" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or <a href="mailto:hi@trnc.co">email</a>. Or check out what I'm currently up to on <a href="/now">this page</a>.

I began working straight out of school in 1999 as a desktop technician getting PC’s ready for the Y2K fallout (<em>biggest con ever</em>).

Since then, I’ve remained in I.T. performing a range of roles from System Administrator to IT Manager to Database Administrator including stints as Team leader and Service Delivery Manager.

Currently, I’m exploring the dark arts of the Middleware arena.

Aside from I.T. work, I write and share my thoughts with the world. Most of my writing is for this blog as well as a few paid-for pieces for individuals, companies, and websites around the world.

<h3>Personal</h3>

I am a family man. My wife and 2 sons mean everything to me. I work hard to provide them a few comforts and a stable home.

I love having my imagination ignited, and this is usually done through the books I read and movies I watch - both of which are often.

Being healthy is important to me. I strive to eat good food and maintain an active lifestyle (such as running, HIIT, and playground agility).

<h3>Quotables</h3>

Quotes can capture the essence of any moment in time or future state we want to aspire to. Here are a few quotes that I remind myself of every day.

<blockquote>“Be silly. Be honest. Be kind.” - Ralph Waldo Emerson

“Nothing changes if nothing changes.” - Proverb

“Which wolf will win? … The one you feed” - Finishing line of an Indian Proverb.

</blockquote>

<h3>Gratitude</h3>

I try and acknowledge, as much as I can, the good things I have in my life. I actively and consciously express gratitude. I am thankful for my glass of water in the morning, my loving wife, my job, even my working limbs.

And I am grateful that you have taken the time to read this far.

Thank you.

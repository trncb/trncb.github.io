The simple act of visiting a website leaves a trail of information, a “digital footprint,” about visitors like you. Sometimes this footprint is vague and preserves your anonymity and other times it is tied specifically to you and your real life identity.

If all you do is click around and read pages, the data captured about you is vague. If you leave a comment or sign up for a newsletter, the data captured about you is sometimes very specific. Almost all websites on the web today collect data in this fashion about visitors, and this site is no different.

It is our belief that you deserve to know how we handle your information. Consequently, the Privacy Policy below is a disclosure concerning our intent with your data. It is not a legally binding contract. It is a statement of intent made in good faith.

If you are unsure what something means, please ask. Contact information is available at the bottom of the Privacy Policy.

<h3>Collection</h3>

We collect anonymous data from every visitor of this website to monitor traffic and fix bugs. For example, we collect information like web requests, the data sent in response to such requests, the Internet Protocol (IP) address, the browser type, the browser language, and a timestamp for the request.

We ask you to sign up for our newsletter in which you provide some personal information (such as name and email address).

We currently use BuyShared to host this website. Raw data is logged on the web servers to monitor health, status, and traffic. The data stored in these logs are listed below.

BuyShared: anonymous (referrer, operating system, browser type, page views, time/date), pseudonymous (IP Address), server (status code, page name, data size)

<h3>Usage</h3>

Data is used for the express purpose of enabling you to read, respond to, and discover published content topical to this site, and nothing else.

<h3>Sharing</h3>

We don't share your personal information with third parties. Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to help us improve this website and service. We currently use Google Analytics (analytics) and Mailchimp (mailing list management). We have listed below what data these third parties extract exactly. Feel free to check out their own Privacy Policies to find out more.

Google Analytics: anonymous (referrer, device, operating system, browser type, demographics, page views, time/date), pseudonymous (IP address)
Mailchimp: name (if provided), email address

We also use social buttons provided by services like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Your use of these services is entirely optional and, if used, you agree to their respective Privacy Policies.

<h3>Contact</h3>

If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact the site owner by emailing myprivacy (at) trnc (dot) co .

<h3>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h3>

Things change. We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make major changes in the way we collect or use information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on this website or sending you an email.

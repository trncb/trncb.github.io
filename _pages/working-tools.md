It is a fine balance between the number of tools I use and the value I gain from them.

Too few tools and I find that it's harder to do what should be an easy job. While too many tools mean switching between apps and introducing too much complexity.

I am a massive fan of keeping things simple. Simplifying my tools simplifies my life and eases my decision fatigue.

Over the years, I have tried many (<em>many!</em>) apps and tools. Even today, I'm always trying alternative apps and methods in an effort to try simplify my life more.

This list contains tools that have stuck with me, or currently make my life simple in a major way.

<h2>Desktop tools</h2>

Due to my job, I work on different operating systems daily. Here are some of my staple tools.

<ul>
    <li>Google Chrome: For everything Internet.</li>
    <li>FileZilla: For FTP and more.</li>
    <li>Notepad++ (Windows): For all my text-file based work, either viewing, modifying or developing.</li>
    <li>Sublime Text (MacOS): For all my text-file based work, either viewing, modifying or developing.</li>
    <li>Visual Studio Code: For developing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Web tools</h2>

Platform independent apps and services I have come to love and rely on.

<ul>
    <li>Google G-Suite: For interlinking mail, docs, drive space, photos, and backups for my family.</li>
    <li>Slack: Team collaboration (including <a href="https://trnc.co/a/how-slack-improved-my-family-life/">for my family life</a>)</li>
    <li>LastPass: For password management.</li>
    <li>Grammarly: Gotta spell and write right, right?</li>
    <li>IFTTT: for automation workflow goodness.</li>
    <li>WordPress: for this website and others.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Random lifestyle tools</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Primary desktop: MacBook Pro 15" 2017 model</li>
    <li>iPhone SE (I’d love an iPhone 8 RED)</li>
    <li>Mazda Premacy (An excellent family vehicle)</li>
    <li>TomTom watch for measuring my workouts and running.</li>
</ul>
